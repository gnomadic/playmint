# DEMO 


PLAYMINT started as a hackathon project, and it shows.

### Play a game
1.  Get [Sepolia testnet eth from a faucet]((https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/)) in your wallet
2.  [mint a free D7 NFT on Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x43b7d111d966e482bff3b908fa1ffe6d2e78f37a?a=0x2273fFEd38ED040FBcd3e45Cd807594d27ebfAE3#writeContract#F2)

4.  Scroll down to the bottom, and call the game functions on sepolia scan with the appropriate addresses and your D7 NFT token ID.  You can call `getNumber` on your entity contract with the Key, your game address, and your NFT ID to see the numbers increment.
