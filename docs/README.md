## What is the Tavern Protocol?

The Tavern Protocol serves as a foundation for the development and management of blockchain-based games. At its core, the protocol provides a set of game building blocks and the means to string them together into gameplay.  Game creators can submit transactions to accomplish all this, and all the information necessary is provided as metadata by the contracts.

## Blockchain Gaming for all

## Game Creation and Management

The Tavern Protocol facilitates the creation and management of blockchain-based games through its core components:

* **Entities:** Store and manage game data uniquely associated with a game, including player details, item attributes, and game state information.
* **Modules (Components):** Pre-built components that handle specific actions within games, such as player movement, combat mechanics, and inventory management.
* **Flows:** Customizable sequences of modules that define gameplay logic, allowing for dynamic and engaging gaming experiences.

By providing developers, game creators, and players with the tools and infrastructure they need, the Tavern Protocol paves the way for a new era of decentralized gaming.
