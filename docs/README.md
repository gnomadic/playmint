# PLAYMINT

## Our Mission:

PLAYMINT empowers communities and their members by enabling the creation of codeless Web3 games built around existing NFTs. We believe in the power of play to foster stronger connections and shared experiences.

## What is PLAYMINT?

PLAYMINT is an on-chain game engine designed specifically for breathing life into existing NFTs and their communities. With PLAYMINT, you can easily create and deploy engaging games that leverage your community's NFTs as playable characters or valuable in-game assets.

## How does PLAYMINT work?

PLAYMINT utilizes a powerful combination of established game engine architecture and modern Web3 modular protocols.

### Entity-Component Architecture:

Every game is built upon entities, which store all the necessary data associated with in-game objects or characters.

These entities are linked to on-chain NFTs, allowing for true ownership and transparent data storage.

### Modular Design:

Games are composed of interchangeable modules that handle specific gameplay mechanics (e.g., combat, crafting, resource management).

This modularity allows for customization and the creation of diverse game experiences.

## What are the core features:

1. Entity Creation: Associate your existing NFT with a PLAYMINT entity, defining its in-game attributes and data.
2. Module Selection: Choose from pre-built modules to integrate desired gameplay mechanics into your game.
3. Community Focus: Deploy your game directly on the blockchain, fostering secure operation and community ownership.
4. NFT Utility: Unlock the full potential of your NFTs by transforming them into playable characters or valuable in-game assets.
