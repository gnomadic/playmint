# ROADMAP

Taverh started as a hackathon project, and it shows.


## Phase 1:  Hackathon

This is where we are today.  It works!  There are three modules, and you can create a game with them.  You can define Game Functions and play your game.  It's not pretty.


## Phase 2: Alpha

The code is:
1.  rough, 
2.  not well-tested
3.  covered in commented out code
4.  not well-documented
5.  full of unnecessary code
6.  missing Access Controls
7.  completely unoptimized

Let's fix that.


## Phase 3: Beta

We need more Modules.  Things like:
1.  combat
2.  crafting
3.  resource management
4.  quests 

## Phase 4: UI

We need a UI.  It should be:
1.  easy to use
2.  intuitive
3.  probably a drag-and-drop interface
